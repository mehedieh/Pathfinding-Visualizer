## What is a pathfinding algorithm?

#### At its core, a pathfinding algorithm seeks to find the shortest path between two points. This application visualizes various pathfinding algorithms in action, and more!

## Not all algorithms are created equal.

*Dijkstra's Algorithm* (weighted): the father of pathfinding algorithms; guarantees the shortest path
